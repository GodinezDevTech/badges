            Hi, I’m Steven Godinez, a first-generation college student from Houston (Go Astros!)
            pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at Northeastern University, with plans to graduate in 2027. My
            passion for technology and problem-solving has driven me to explore the intersection of
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I’m already preparing for a Masters of
            Science in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Machine Learning to deepen my expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I’m building innovative projects like an AI-Driven Cyber Threat Detection and
            Response System, designed to predict and combat cyber threats in real-time. These
            projects reflect my commitment to creating impactful, cutting-edge solutions to
            real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I strive to bring curiosity and creativity to my work,
            whether it’s organizing HackBeanpot’s hackathon or refining my skills
            through coding challenges.
            When I’m not immersed in tech, you might find me riding my

            Harley 2013 Fat Bob, trying out new coffee shops
             or powerlifting.

            Feel free to explore my GitHub, ask about my latest AI project, or connect with me to
            chat about tech, bikes, or how to tackle the next big challenge!
