                        The Idea for this project came from the rapid growth on Artificial Intelligence
                        in the field of CS. This Software creates a blend between Cybersecurity and
                        AI. With currently 2 different versions, web and business. The web version is
                        built for those who own websites and wish to project them against hackers and
                        attacks such as XSS or SQL injections through my trained model. The business
                        version is a little more robust. The vision for the business version is to have
                        my model track information such as, log in times, usual package sizes, network analyzer,
                        location of log in times, unusual sign ins, and much more. Each person will have
                        their own personalized version of their activities that is monitored and learns
                        through AI unsupervised learning. All unusual activities is to be reported to
                        company executives through a dashboard with all of this information. Both the business
                        and web version include a database of blocked IPs that have been deemed suspicious.

                        This Software is meant to be used as a tool for those who want to learn how to
                        buy, sell, and grow their stocks in a safe environment. This software works by
                        an API that allows the program to update on the latest information on stocks.
                        A user is then able to use the GUI as an application in order to buy, sell, store
                        stocks. This safe environment also has secret features that allows the user to
                        learn more about their portfolios built and their growth.
